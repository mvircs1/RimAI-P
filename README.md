# RimAI Beta

RimAI is a RimWorld mod that replaces the traditional storyteller with AI-powered narrative generation. The mod uses AI to create contextual events based on your colony's current state, generating dynamic stories and challenges.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have RimWorld installed and the Harmony mod (available on Steam Workshop or GitHub).
2. Copy the entire "RimAI Beta" folder to your RimWorld mods folder (usually located at `Documents/My Games/RimWorld/Mods`).
3. Launch RimWorld and go to the mods menu to enable RimAI.
4. Configure your OpenRouter API key in the mod settings if required.
